/** Java Custom annotations or Java User-defined annotations are easy to create and use.
 * The @interface element is used to declare an annotation. For example:

@interface MyAnnotation{}
Here, MyAnnotation is the custom annotation name.

        There are few points that should be remembered by the programmer:

        -Method should not have any throws clauses
        -Method should return one of the following: primitive data types, String, Class, enum or array of these data types.
        -Method should not have any parameter.
        -We should attach @ just before interface keyword to define annotation.
        -It may assign a default value to the method.

        There are three types of annotations:

        Marker Annotation
        Single-Value Annotation
        Multi-Value Annotation
